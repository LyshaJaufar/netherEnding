# NetherEnding

# Gameplay

Hello, Teddy Wizard. Unfortunately, you've fallen into a nether portal and now you're trapped in The Nether. Luckily for you, the villagers would be glad to welcome you to their village if you protect them from a never-ending swarm of zombie pigmen. 

Use W, A, S, D keys to move and ENTER key to use your diamond sword to kill the zombie pigmen. Kill as many as you can!
